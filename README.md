# How to run

The Release package includes an examplar peer identity private key.
Double click on AbyssUI.exe to run the Abyss browser.

To run multiple instances of the Abyss browser, copy the entire folder in different location, delete the default identity private key, and generate another private key using the command below.
The command must be executed using powershell.

```
ssh-keygen -t ed25519 -f "my_key.pem" -N '""' > $null
```

Use another file name instead of "my_key.pem".


# How to build Abyss browser

To build the binaries, you need
* go version go1.24.3 windows/amd64
* visual studio 2022 with C# .net8.0 and windows dev package.
* unity 3D 2022.3.40f1

The prototype Abyss browser source codes are separeted in three folders:
1) abyss_core
2) abyss_engine
3) abyss_unity
   
In abyss_core folder, build_dll.ps1 will build "abyssnet.dll" and copy it to ../abyss_engine/bin/Debug/net8.0/ folder.

Then, in abyss_engine folder, we provided the entire visual studio project to build the AbyssCLI.exe file.
After building, export_unity.ps1 will copy your bin/Debug/net8.0/ folder to ../abyss_unity/AbyssCLI.

Lastly, abyss_unity folder contains two folders, Assets and AbyssCLI.
To build unity project, you need to first make an empty 3D project, close unity editor, and overwrite the Assets folder.
Also, place AbyssCLI folder in the same folder with the Assets folder -- so that the directory structure is like:

```md
YourProject
├── Assets
├── AbyssCLI
└── ...
```

If you find any problem building, please let us know.
Thank you.

# Limitations

As NAT traversal itself is not our main research interest, we only tested our implementation without NAT, with each peer allocated a static IP.
It is highly likely that peers behind different NAT device will not be able to connect each other.
